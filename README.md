# ZK Workshops

Welcome to the Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Workshops repository, organized by Privacy & Scaling Explorations (PSE) EcoDev team. This repository contains materials, resources, and hands-on exercises for workshop participants.

### 🌍 **Our Mission**
> _"Growing the next generation of ZK talent."_  

We believe **privacy, scalability, and verifiable computation** are the pillars of the future Web3 ecosystem. These workshops empower **students, early-career developers, and aspiring ZK leaders** with the knowledge and skills to start their journey and eventually contribute meaningfully to the field.

## 🎯 Who Should Attend?
✅ Students and developers **interested in ZK cryptography**  
✅ Individuals looking to **become local ZK community leaders**  
✅ Researchers aiming to **deepen their understanding of ZK proofs**  
✅ Engineers eager to **contribute to open-source ZK projects**  

### Workshop Format
- **Duration**: 2-day intensive workshop
- **Focus**: Mathematical foundations of zero-knowledge proofs
- **Style**: Mix of theory, whiteboard sessions, and hands-on coding
- **Target Audience**: Students and individuals passionate about becoming leaders in their local ZK communities
