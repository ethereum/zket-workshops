# zkVM Design: From Theory to Practice

This folder contains materials for the **Design of zkVM from theory to practice** session led by Yao.

## Session Overview

**Time**: 10:00 AMâ€“12:00 PM  
**Mentor**: Yao  
**Focus**: Bridging the gap between zkVM theory and practical implementation

## Learning Objectives

- Understand zkVM architecture and design principles
- Learn about different zkVM approaches and trade-offs
- Explore the relationship between ZKP schemes and zkVM design
- See real-world zkVM implementations and their design decisions

## Materials

- Session slides and presentations
- Architecture diagrams and design patterns
- Code examples from existing zkVMs
- Design exercises and case studies

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of ZK basics and ZKP schemes (Day 1)
- Basic programming experience
- Familiarity with virtual machine concepts helpful

## Key Topics

- zkVM architecture overview
- Instruction set design considerations
- Memory model and state management
- Proof generation and verification integration
- Performance optimization strategies
- Security considerations and trade-offs

## Next Steps

This session provides the design foundation for:
- Practical zkVM implementation (afternoon session)
- Building and demoing zkVM applications
- Understanding real-world zkVM projects
