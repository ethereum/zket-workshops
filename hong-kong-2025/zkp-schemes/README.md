# ZKP Schemes in zkVMs

This folder contains materials for the **ZKP schemes: how to apply them in zkVM** session led by Yao.

## Session Overview

**Time**: 2:30â€“5:30 PM  
**Mentor**: Yao  
**Focus**: Understanding how different ZKP schemes work within zkVM contexts

## Learning Objectives

- Learn about various ZKP schemes (Groth16, PlonK, etc.)
- Understand how ZKP schemes integrate with zkVMs
- Explore the trade-offs between different approaches
- See practical examples of ZKP scheme selection

## Materials

- Session slides and presentations
- Code examples and demonstrations
- Comparative analysis of different schemes
- Hands-on exercises

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of ZK basics (morning sessions)
- Basic familiarity with lattice-based approaches
- Programming experience helpful

## Key Topics

- Overview of popular ZKP schemes
- zkVM architecture and requirements
- Scheme selection criteria
- Performance and security considerations
- Integration patterns and best practices

## Next Steps

This session provides the theoretical foundation for:
- zkVM design from theory to practice (Day 2 morning)
- Practical zkVM implementation (Day 2 afternoon)
- Project development and demos
