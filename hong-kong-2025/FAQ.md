## General Questions

### What is the Hong Kong ZK Workshop?
A two-day, hands-on introduction to Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and their real-world applications. We'll cover core concepts, explore modern tooling, and showcase practical zkVM applications.

### Who can attend?
Anyone curious about ZK or crypto: developers, students, researchers, finance professionals, or blockchain newcomers. No heavy math background required.

### When & where?
- **Date**: July 19–20, 2025
- **Time**: 10:00 AM – 5:30 PM (both days)
- **Venue**: Terminal 3 office, Quarry Bay, Hong Kong

### What's the format?
Mix of lectures, live coding demos, small-group exercises, and project brainstorming. Day 1 focuses on foundations; Day 2 on modern zkVMs and demos.
